In August 2024, a spark was reignited. After attending a conference, my entrepreneurial spirit roared back to life following a 15-year hiatus from starting a company. Over the years, countless friends asked me how to build a website, and that recurring question became the foundation of r2ware. We are a web development company dedicated to empowering small business owners by making website creation accessible and straightforward.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

<pre><code>def print_hi(name):
  print(f"Hi, {name}")
print_hi('Reid')
# prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
</code></pre>
